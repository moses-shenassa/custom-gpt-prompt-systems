Prompt: 
<instruction>Think very hard and use any and all resources to develop a comprehensive, thorough, world class rubric for a perfect fight analysis and prediction method.</instruction> <output> The full rubric</output>

Response:
Here’s a full-blown, “world class” rubric you can use to design, judge, and refine any fight analysis/prediction system.

You can treat it as a checklist and a scoring framework (e.g., 1–5 per item). I’ll lay it out in sections with explicit criteria for what “perfect” looks like.

RUBRIC FOR A PERFECT FIGHT ANALYSIS & PREDICTION METHOD

You can score each item from 1–5:

1–2: Poor / superficial / missing

3: Adequate but incomplete

4: Strong but with minor gaps

5: World-class, thorough, and consistent

You can then average within each section and across sections.

I. DATA GATHERING & INPUT QUALITY

Goal: The system starts from the best possible information set, not vibes.

Source Breadth & Reliability

Checks multiple sources (official records, BoxRec, news reports, interviews, tape, punch stats, odds markets, etc.).

Verifies key facts (weight, date, location, records) rather than assuming.

Flags any discrepancies between sources.

Recency & Relevance of Data

Prioritizes recent fights, especially at the same weight class.

Adjusts for fights that are old, at different weights, or clearly not representative of current form.

Explicitly notes when “the best tape” is outdated and accounts for that uncertainty.

Completeness of Fighter Information

Collects: record, KO %, height, reach, stance, age, layoff, injuries/rumors, trainer, gym, usual weight on fight night, etc.

Includes context on last 3–5 fights: opposition level, style, damage taken, controversies.

Contextual Environment Data

Location, time zone, altitude, climate.

Commission/judging tendencies (e.g., volume vs power, home fighter bias).

Promotional/TV politics and A-side/B-side dynamics.

Travel and short notice factors.

Data Quality Control & Gaps

Explicitly lists missing data or uncertainties (“no reliable punch stats,” “no recent interviews on weight cut,” etc.).

Assigns confidence levels to key data points.

Where data is thin, uses cautious priors (not wild guesses).

Perfect (5/5): System always enters analysis with a rich, verified dataset and explicitly knows what it doesn’t know.

II. FIGHTER PROFILING QUALITY

Goal: Each fighter is understood in a deep, multi-dimensional way.

II.A Technical & Tactical Profile

Offensive Skill Breakdown

Jab, cross, hooks, uppercuts, body work, combinations, feints.

Shot selection vs different styles (tall guys, pressure fighters, southpaws, etc.).

Ability to punch off the back foot, in combination, and in transitions.

Defensive Skill Breakdown

Head movement, footwork, guard discipline, parries, slips, shoulder roll.

Use of clinch, framing, and smothering.

History of specific vulnerabilities (e.g., left hooks, uppercuts, straight right vs southpaws).

Ring IQ & Adjustments

Evidence of mid-fight changes in plan.

Ability to exploit opponent patterns.

History of doing better/worse in rematches or later rounds vs early rounds.

Pace & Distance Management

Preferred distance (inside, mid-range, long).

Comfort at different paces (high volume vs slow tempo).

Skill at dictating where and how the fight is fought.

II.B Physical Attributes

Size & Natural Weight

True walking-around weight & rehydration size, not just listed division.

How the fighter carries weight moving up or down (loss of speed, gain in durability, etc.).

Power & Strength

Distinguishes between one-punch KO power vs accumulative damage.

Notes power carry-over between weight classes.

Uses more than KO% (e.g., who they dropped, how durable those opponents were).

Speed, Reflexes & Athleticism

Hand speed, foot speed, reaction time.

Explosiveness vs sustained speed.

Differences early vs late in fights.

Durability & Recovery

Chin: who has hurt or dropped them, and with what.

Body resistance: history of body shot issues.

Recovery behavior: do they clinch smart, move, or panic?

Conditioning / Gas Tank

History of fading late, second winds, or finishing strong.

Ability to maintain output under pressure.

Any known issues with stamina at specific weights.

II.C Psychological & Intangible Profile

Mental Toughness & “Dog”

Past instances of fighting through cuts, knockdowns, bad scorecards, etc.

Willingness to bite down vs safety-first tendencies.

Composure & Emotional Control

How they respond to being hurt, cut, or frustrated.

Does ego lead them into dumb exchanges? Do they stick to the plan?

Confidence vs Delusion

Is self-belief grounded in tested opposition or padded?

Any signs of denial post-loss, excuses, or poor accountability.

Lifestyle & Professionalism

Weight issues, ballooning between fights.

Camp discipline, known gym habits, reported sparring stories (carefully weighted).

Trainer & Corner Quality

Track record of the coach with similar fights and opponents.

Corner advice in past fights: clear, tactical, calm vs chaotic or useless.

Perfect (5/5): System produces a multi-page mental dossier of each fighter that feels like what a top trainer or matchmaker would say if you interviewed them for an hour.

III. STYLE MATCHUP & INTERACTION QUALITY

Goal: It’s not “who’s better,” it’s how their styles and attributes interact.

Primary Style Classification

Correctly labels each fighter: boxer, boxer-puncher, pressure fighter, counterpuncher, volume swarmer, spoiler, etc.

Notes secondary modes they can switch to (e.g., boxer who can brawl when needed).

Southpaw/Orthodox Dynamics

Analyzes specific lefty-righty patterns (rear-hand lanes, lead foot battle).

Checks each fighter’s past record vs opposite-stance opponents.

Distance Interaction

Predicts who likely wins at long, mid, and inside range.

Identifies “no-go zones” (e.g., short fighter stuck on the end of the jab, tall fighter stuck on the ropes vs hooker).

Pace Interaction

Evaluates how each fighter’s preferred pace collides:

High-volume vs low-volume.

Hot starter vs slow starter.

Identifies who is more likely to drag the fight toward their preferred tempo.

Tactical Weapon Interactions

Connects specific weapons to specific vulnerabilities:

E.g., Fighter A’s counter left hook vs Fighter B’s habit of jabbing with chin up.

Prioritizes which weapons are likely to be decisive.

Control of Ring Geography

Who is better at cutting the ring vs circling.

Who handles ropes/corners better.

Likely pattern of where exchanges will happen.

Perfect (5/5): System can tell a coherent “style story” for how the fight will likely look on TV, round by round.

IV. OPPOSITION, FORM & HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Goal: Understand not just records but who they beat, when, and how.

Strength of Schedule

Adjusts records for quality of opposition: world level, fringe world, regional, journeymen, cans.

Includes stylistic relevance of past opponents to the current matchup.

Recent Form & Trend

Looks at the last 3–5 fights as a trend line.

Notes: improving, plateauing, or declining (slower, more hittable, less output).

Damage & Mileage

Identifies wars, brutal KOs, chronic cut issues, and long layoffs after beatings.

Adjusts for “old 30 vs young 30” based on miles, not just age.

Weight Class Evolution

Tracks the fighter’s movement up/down weights.

Notes where they looked best and where they struggled.

Evaluates whether they’re growing into a class or aging out of it.

Historical Analog Fights

Finds past matchups with similar style/attribute dynamics.

Uses analogues to refine priors (e.g., boxer moving up vs bigger puncher, small slickster vs relentless pressure, etc.).

Stays realistic—no forced analogies.

Perfect (5/5): System can convincingly answer “What does this performance say about this fighter today in this weight class, not 3 years ago?”

V. SCENARIO BUILDING & FIGHT TEXTURE

Goal: Generate realistic, detailed “what-it-looks-like” scenarios.

Multi-Scenario Modeling

Builds at least:

Fighter A’s best-case scenario.

Fighter B’s best-case scenario.

One or two “messy” or hybrid scenarios.

Each scenario is internally coherent and anchored in actual traits.

Early / Middle / Late Rounds Dynamics

Distinguishes how the first 4 rounds may differ from 5–8 and 9–12.

Incorporates fatigue, adjustments, and accumulation.

Risk Event Modeling

Identifies likely points of crisis: knockdowns, cuts, swings in momentum.

Evaluates how each fighter historically responds to those events.

Pathways to Victory

Clearly articulates what has to happen for each fighter to win (e.g., A must neutralize jab, win body work, avoid left hook exchanges; B must get inside by round 4, sustain pressure, and break down body).

Failure Modes for Each Scenario

For each main scenario, the system checks: “What would break this?” and tracks that as a risk factor.

Perfect (5/5): System feels like it’s pre-watching alternate versions of the fight and mapping them systematically.

VI. PROBABILITY & OUTCOME CALIBRATION

Goal: Turn qualitative analysis into calibrated probabilities and concrete picks.

Outcome Space Definition

At minimum:

Fighter A: KO/TKO (early, mid, late), Decision.

Fighter B: KO/TKO (early, mid, late), Decision.

Optional: Draw/technical decision/other small bucket.

Refuses to compress everything into one lazy “50/50.”

Consistency of Probabilities

Probabilities sum to 100%.

Distribution reflects the logic of the analysis (no contradictions like “A dominates late” but giving B late KO as biggest chunk).

Calibration Against History

Uses historical priors: how often fights with similar dynamics end by KO vs decision, and whose favor they tilt.

Attempts to be well-calibrated over time (e.g., if it says 60% a certain outcome, that type of prediction should come true ~60% long-term).

Separation of Skill Edge vs KO Threat

Distinguishes: “X is more skilled overall” vs “Y has more ways to end it suddenly.”

Distributes probabilities accordingly.

Confidence Rating on Main Pick

Provides a confidence score (0–100) for the main predicted outcome.

Explains why it’s not higher (sources of uncertainty).

Perfect (5/5): If you tracked its predictions for 100+ fights, the frequencies of outcomes would roughly match the stated probabilities.

VII. BIAS CONTROL, SELF-CRITIQUE & ROBUSTNESS

Goal: Catch fan bias, recency bias, hype, and narrative traps.

Bias Detection

Actively checks for:

Star power bias.

Hype from promoters and media.

Overvaluing KO highlights vs full context.

Recency bias from one spectacular win or loss.

Debate-Style Internal Check

System can “argue the case” for each fighter as if it believes in them, then compare which case is stronger.

Revises priors if the “underdog argument” is more compelling than initially assumed.

Explicit Uncertainty Accounting

Lists what is unknown or speculative (new weight class, injuries, new trainer, long layoff, etc.).

Distributes uncertainty across outcomes instead of burying it.

If-I’m-Wrong Modeling

Clearly states, “If I’m wrong, here is what the fight will probably look like.”

Identifies early-round indicators that would justify changing a live prediction or betting angle.

Post-Fight Backtesting (Meta-Loop)

After the fight, the system reviews:

What it got right.

What it misread (power, chin, adjustments, judges, etc.).

Updates future priors for similar fighters/scenarios.

Perfect (5/5): Over time, the system learns from its misses and becomes less likely to repeat the same mistakes.

VIII. COMMUNICATION & USABILITY

Goal: The method’s outputs are clear enough for sharp fans, coaches, and bettors to use.

Structured Output

Uses a consistent template: fighter profiles, dimensional comparison, scenarios, probabilities, final pick, self-critique.

Easy to skim or read deeply.

Separation of Fact, Inference & Speculation

Clearly marks:

Facts (records, dates, weights).

Inferences (based on patterns).

Speculation (gym rumors, unverified stories).

Avoids blurring them.

Actionable Insights

Points out stylistic tells to watch for early.

Highlights where the line/odds may be off relative to its probabilities (without overpromising).

Transparency of Reasoning

Someone could reconstruct the logic and say, “I see exactly how it got to that conclusion, even if I disagree.”

No hand-wavy “X just has that dog in him” without structural support.

Adaptability to Different Audiences

Can zoom in for coaches (technical detail) or zoom out for bettors (probabilities, key edges) without changing the core logic.

Perfect (5/5): A sharp coach, a pro bettor, and a hardcore fan all find it legible, serious, and critique-ready.

HOW TO USE THIS RUBRIC

For building a system:
Treat each numbered item as a design requirement. Don’t move on until you can honestly say, “Yes, my method does this.”

For grading a given analysis (yours or mine):
Score 1–5 on each item, average by section, then globally.

4.5–5.0 average: elite, world-class predictive method.

3.5–4.4: strong but with clear upgrade points.

<3.5: missing critical elements for high-accuracy prediction.

If you want, next step can be: we take one of your past analyses (or mine) and score it against this rubric, then refine the analysis framework until it hits “world-class” across the board.

Prompt:
<task>apply this rubric to all analyses you perform from now on.</task>
<context>this must be applied to every analysis you perform in this conversation</context>
<method>The method for applying this rubric is as follows:
1 - create your analysis
2 - compare your analysis to the rubric
3 - if the analysis scores perfectly against the rubric, it is complete; otherwise, refine your analysis against the rubric
4. go to step 2</method>
<importantInfo>You must remember this for the duration of this conversation</importantInfo>

Response:
Understood. For this conversation, every fight analysis I do will:

1. **Use the full multi-dimensional system we’ve built** (technical, physical, psychological, style, resume, context, scenarios, probabilities, self-critique).
2. **Run through the rubric you just defined as an internal QA pass**:

   * Build the analysis.
   * Check it systematically against each rubric section (data, profiling, style interaction, scenarios, probability calibration, bias checks, communication).
   * Refine where it falls short.
3. Only once it internally clears that rubric will I present it to you.

I’ll treat the rubric as the standard for “done” on every analysis in this thread.

Whenever you’re ready with the next [FIGHT DETAILS], I’ll run the full process under those rules.
