# Boxing Analysis Rubric

This rubric defines the evaluation categories the model must use when analyzing
a boxing match. It ensures consistency, prevents drift, and provides a
repeatable structure for technical predictions.

For each category, the analyst should think through the listed dimensions and
use them to support the final forecast.

---

## 1. Technical Profile

### Offensive Tools
- Jab quality (speed, accuracy, variety)
- Rear-hand threat level
- Combination patterns
- Feint usage
- Shot selection & set-ups

### Defensive Systems
- Guard discipline
- Head movement patterns
- Footwork exits
- Distance management
- Ability to neutralize attacks (parries, clinch, pivots)

### Ring IQ
- Adaptability mid-fight
- Ability to read opponents and make adjustments
- Predictability level
- Comfort under pressure / in exchanges

**Goal:** Identify which fighter has the more *complete and reliable* technical
toolkit, and where exploitable gaps exist.

---

## 2. Physical Attributes

- Punching power (one-shot vs accumulation)
- Hand speed vs. timing
- Reach and leverage efficiency
- Gas tank consistency across rounds
- Durability history (chin, body, cuts)

**Goal:** Determine who has the more sustainable physical edge over the
scheduled distance of the fight.

---

## 3. Psychological Factors

- Resilience under adversity
- Confidence trends and recent form
- Reaction to being hurt or cut
- Discipline and focus across training camps
- Trainer and team stability

**Goal:** Assess which fighter is more likely to stay composed, follow a game
plan, and recover from setbacks.

---

## 4. Stylistic Interaction

- Southpaw vs orthodox dynamics (if relevant)
- Counterpunching layers
- Pressure vs movement archetype
- Who controls distance and ring geography
- Likely exchanges and who wins them
- Historical analog fights (similar style pairings)

**Goal:** Describe the most probable flow of the fight based on stylistic
interactions, not just isolated traits.

---

## 5. Prediction Criteria

The final prediction should synthesize:

- Technical advantages (Section 1)
- Physical advantages (Section 2)
- Psychological edges (Section 3)
- Stylistic matchups (Section 4)

### Confidence Score Guide (0–100%)

- **90–100%** – Highly one-sided matchup with extensive data.
- **75–89%** – Clear favorite with some plausible upset paths.
- **60–74%** – Competitive fight with a slight but reasoned lean.
- **50–59%** – Essentially a pick’em; choose a side but emphasize volatility.

The analyst must:
- State **winner**, **method**, and **confidence %**.
- Mention **key conditions** that would flip the outcome (e.g., “If Fighter B
  can consistently back A to the ropes, the edge narrows significantly.”)

This rubric prevents opinion-only analysis by enforcing structured reasoning.
