> “Analyze Fighter A vs Fighter B using the full rubric.”

## Output (sample)

### 1. Technical Profile Comparison

**Offensive Tools**

- **Fighter A**: Long, accurate jab used to control range; consistent 1–2–3
  combinations aimed high–low–high. Mixes in body hooks after establishing the
  jab.  
- **Fighter B**: Rear-hand dominant puncher who looks for counters. Jab is
  sporadic and mainly a range finder. Limited variety in combinations.

**Defensive Systems**

- **Fighter A**: High guard with reactive parries and small head movement. Uses
  pivots to reset when pressured but can be slow to see looping hooks over the
  guard.  
- **Fighter B**: Slip-and-counter style with good head movement in the pocket
  but feet often stay planted. Vulnerable to sustained body jabs and level
  changes.

**Ring IQ**

- **Fighter A**: Demonstrated mid-fight adjustments in past bouts (changed
  tempo, altered jab targets, circled away from power side).  
- **Fighter B**: When forced backwards, tends to repeat the same counter right
  and struggles to build Plan B offense.

### 2. Physical Attributes

- **Reach & Leverage**: Fighter A has a 3 cm reach advantage and uses it
  effectively with the jab. Fighter B’s shorter reach is partly offset by
  explosive bursts in mid-range.  
- **Speed vs Timing**: Fighter B has slightly faster hands, but Fighter A has
  better rhythm and timing control.  
- **Conditioning**: Fighter A has finished 12-round fights at a consistent
  output. Fighter B’s work rate drops noticeably after Round 7.  
- **Durability**: Both have taken clean shots; Fighter B has one stoppage loss
  to body shots, suggesting a target area.

---

### 3. Psychological Factors

- **Fighter A**: Enters with positive momentum after two high-output decision
  wins. Handles pressure crowds well and has shown composure after being cut.  
- **Fighter B**: Coming off a KO loss; public comments emphasize “proving
  people wrong,” which may lead to forcing exchanges instead of disciplined
  setups.

Uncertainty note: Limited footage on Fighter B’s new trainer, so assumptions
about improved defense are speculative.

### 4. Stylistic Interaction

- Fighter A’s active jab and footwork favor a **range-control** fight where B
  is pressured to close distance and take risks.  
- Fighter B is most dangerous early, especially if he can time overhand rights
  over A’s jab.  
- Over a long fight, Fighter A’s body work and jab variation are likely to
  sap B’s output and reduce his explosiveness.

Historical analog: This resembles a classic boxer vs puncher matchup, where
the disciplined jabber with better gas tank tends to pull away late if the
chin holds up.

### 5. Outcome Forecast

**Predicted Winner:** Fighter A  
**Method:** Unanimous Decision over 12 rounds  
**Confidence:** 74%  

**Reasoning:** Fighter A has the more complete technical toolkit, superior jab,
and proven conditioning. Fighter B’s power and early counterpunch threat are
real, but his tendency to fade late and difficulty fighting on the back foot
make a sustained, disciplined performance from A the most probable outcome.
If Fighter B consistently traps A on the ropes and lands clean early, the
stoppage risk increases and the prediction confidence would drop closer to
60%.
