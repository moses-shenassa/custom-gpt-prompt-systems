# Sigilizer — Examples

## Example 1

Intention:
“Calm and focused study.”

### Phase A
- Clean letters: CALMNDFOUSETY
- Numeric sequence: 3 1 4 4 5 4 6 3 5 1 2 5 7

### Planetary Choice
- Mercury (study, communication)

### Phase B
- Numbers > 8 reduced (40 → 4 etc.)
- Sequence mapped onto the Mercury kamea.
- Start point marked with a circle.
- End point marked with a cap.

Result:
- Grid version and clean version exported as PNG/SVG.

## Example 2

Intention:
“Protect my home.”

### Phase A
- Clean letters: PROTECTMYH
- Numeric sequence: 7 9 6 2 5 3 4 4 7 8

### Planetary Choice
- Mars (protection, boundaries)

### Phase B
- Sequence traced over the Mars kamea.
- Intersections emphasize structural reinforcement.

This demonstrates the full workflow from phrase → reduction → mapping.
