# Sigilizer — Examples

These examples show the full workflow from intention → Phase A reduction →
Phase B mapping decisions.

## Example 1: Calm and Focused Study

**Intention:**  
> “Calm and focused study.”

### Phase A

- Clean letters: `CALMNDFOUSETY`  
- Numeric sequence: `3 1 4 4 5 4 6 3 5 1 2 5 7`

### Planetary Choice (Phase B)

- Selected kamea: **Mercury** (study, communication)

### Phase B Notes

- Numbers above Mercury’s max cell reduced by removing zeros (if any).
- Sequence mapped onto the Mercury kamea.
- Start point marked with a circle.
- End point marked with a cap.
- Two versions produced:
  - Grid + path (for verification)
  - Clean path only (for use as a symbol)

Result: a sigil emphasizing mental clarity, communication, and focus.

## Example 2: Protect My Home

**Intention:**  
> “Protect my home.”

### Phase A

- Clean letters: `PROTECTMYH`  
- Numeric sequence: `7 9 6 2 5 3 4 4 7 8`

### Planetary Choice (Phase B)

- Selected kamea: **Mars** (protection, boundaries, courage)

### Phase B Notes

- Numeric sequence fits Mars’s grid after compatibility check.
- Path emphasizes repeated “4” as structural reinforcement points.
- Start and end markers applied as in the rule set.
- Rendered in both grid and clean variants.

Result: a sigil emphasizing assertive protection and boundary-setting.

These examples demonstrate how the Sigilizer system can be treated as a
deterministic symbolic workflow, independent of any specific spiritual or
religious framing.
