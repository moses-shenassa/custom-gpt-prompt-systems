# Sigilizer — Phase B Rules (Structure & Mapping)

Phase B selects the appropriate structural grid (kamea) and maps the reduced
numeric sequence to it.

## Steps

1. **Planetary Selection**
   Choose the planetary kamea based on the user’s intention category.

2. **Kamea Compatibility Check**
   If numeric values exceed the kamea’s max cell:
   - Reduce by removing zeros (e.g., 40 → 4)
   - Do not do digital root reduction unless the system specifies it.

3. **Path Construction**
   - Plot each number sequentially on the kamea grid.
   - Draw a line connecting points in order.
   - Mark the **start point with a circle**.
   - Mark the **end point with a perpendicular short cap**.

4. **Output Variants**
   - **Grid Version** (verification)
   - **Clean Sigil Version** (no grid)

Phase B produces the final symbolic form that can be used in engraving.
