# Custom GPT Prompt Systems

A collection of structured, multi-stage prompt systems designed for **Custom GPT workflows**, applied reasoning tasks, and domain-specific assistants. Each folder contains:

- A **system prompt** (core instructions + behavior rules)
- A **rubric** or structural framework for reasoning
- **Examples** showing how the model should respond
- Safety & capability boundaries
- Commentary on failure modes

These examples demonstrate how I design prompts for:
- Predictive reasoning (Boxing Analysis System)
- Symbolic/transformative workflows (Sigilizer)
- Real-world operational assistants (Retreat Logistics, Solar Sales)

All systems here are fully self-contained and ready to use as modular components in Custom GPTs or other LLM-driven applications.
